# Introduction

These cheats were taken thanks to **gameconqueror**. the following games are available in this cheat repository:

* HellTaker

# Note

To be more effective these cheats, you have to disable aslr in linux. You can do that by running as root the following command:

```

echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

```

**WARNING**: Your linux system will be vulnerable to buffer overflow, to enable aslr run the following command

```

echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

```

# How to use these cheats

Since there's not a trainer yet you have to load the list of cheats manually in gameconqueror.
* Open gameconqueror
* Click on the green arrow icon
* Go to the folder where you have cloned this repository
* Go to the folder of the game you're playing at the moment
* Open the the file usually called as gamename_cheats
* During your gameplay you will see some variables changing value inside gameconqueror's table, edit the row you want to change inside the table and then continue to play
